		<h1>The Sun</h1>
			<p><span style="font-style:regular;font-weight:regular">
			The sun is a yellow dwarf star located in the Milky Way Galaxy. It is 
			surrounded by many celestial bodies, including 8 planets and 244 moons.</span><br />
			<br /><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:regular">The Sun, with all those 
			planets revolving around it and dependent upon it, can still ripen a bunch of 
			grapes as if it had nothing else in the Universe to do.</span> - Johannes&nbsp;Kepler, 
			'The Harmonies of the World'&copy;,&nbsp;1619</p>

	<!--This section is about the moon-->
		<h1>The Moon</h1>
		<p><span style="font-style:regular;font-weight:regular">
			Moons are large round objects that circle a planet or something else that is
			and that is not a star, that shines at night by reflecting light from the sun.
			While there are 244 that revolve around the 8 planets that revolve around the
			sun, there is only one The Moon.</span><br />
			<br /><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:regular">If the moon, in the 
			act of completing its eternal way around the earth, were gifted with 
			self-consciousness, it would feel thoroughly convinced that it was traveling 
			its way of its own accord on the strength of a resolution taken once and for 
			all.</span> - Albert&nbsp;Einstein</p>
