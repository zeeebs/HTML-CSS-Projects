		<h2>How Do Light Bulbs Work</h2>
			<p>When a light bulb connects to an electrical power supply, 
			an electrical current flows from one metal contact to the other. 
			As the current travels through the wires and the filament, the 
			filament heats up to the point where it begins to emit photons, 
			which are small packets of visible light.</p>
